## Critical Pharmacokinetic Consideration: Delayed Gastric Emptying

**IMPORTANT:** Semaglutide SLOWS gastric emptying, which can affect the absorption of orally administered medications. This is a class effect of all GLP-1 receptor agonists.

### Impact on Oral Medications
- **Mechanism:** Delayed gastric emptying prolongs the time oral medications remain in the stomach
- **Effect:** May alter the rate of absorption (Cmax and Tmax) of co-administered oral drugs
- **Clinical Significance:** Although AUC (total absorption) is often unchanged, peak concentrations may be affected
- **Most Affected:** Medications with narrow therapeutic windows or time-sensitive effects
- **Source:** FDA Prescribing Information; Healthline Drug Interactions
